## This fork
Changes list compared to https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer:
* unstructured commits yield in patch versions
* most other commit types yield in patch versions
* you can disable some version change types by specifying allowed version types in package.json like this:
```
  "publishConfig": {
    "tag": "1x"
  },
  "release": {
    "branch": "1x",
    "analyzeCommits": {
        "path": "./node_modules/freeform-semantic-commit-analyzer/dist/index.js",
        "allowed": ["patch", "minor"],
        "fallback": "minor"
    }
  }
```
Here, only 'patch' and 'minor' version changes are allowed - this is a package for legacy 1.x branch and we don't want
it to jump out of 1.x versions range ocasionally. Default fallback version type is 'patch'.
